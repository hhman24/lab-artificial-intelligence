Practice about Search Strategies, Decision Tree with scikit-learn

## Search Strategies

- `BFS`: Breadth-first search
- `DFS`: Tree-search depth-first search
- `UCS`: Uniform-cost search
- `IDS`: Iterative deepening search
- `GBFS`: Greedy best first search
- `AStar`: Graph-search A* 
- `HC`: Steepest-ascent Hill-climbing

Run the above strategies on a set of 3 different graphs

## Decision Tree with scikit-learn
Build a decision tree on the Mushroom dataset, with the support 
from scikit-learn library.

About the Mushroom data set. This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled 
mushrooms. Each species is identified as either edible or poisonous. There are 8124 samples, each of 
which is characterized by 22 attributes and a target attribute.The original data comes from the [UCI Machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom). You may refer to this page 
for more information.
